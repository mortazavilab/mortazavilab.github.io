          **Research Interests:**
          \nI have three main projects. The first is my main thesis project investigating a time-series of embryonic stem cell differentiation to neuronal and endodermal lineages via RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in multiple mammalian species. The transcriptional and chromatin information gathered from these time courses are used to build and compare gene regulatory networks for each lineage and species. The second and third projects are related collaboration projects in collaboration with the Baram lab at UC Irvine. Both projects investigate early life stress (ELS) and how early life experiences can affect gene expression and contribute to mental illness in adulthood. The first of these investigates single cell transcriptomics of Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing neurons of the mouse hypothalamus after a model of ELS. Cells from the hypothalamus are separated via FACS and the transcriptome is analyzed via single cell RNA-seq. The second related project investigates methylation heterogeneity in human babies via buccal swabs during the first year of life to investigate a range of ELS in humans.

            **Research Interests:**
            \nI use sequencing technologies to explore epigenetics and gene expression in development of diseases and in non-model organisms.
            \nMy main work in collaboration with the Yokomori lab focuses on investigating the transcriptomeand epigenome in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). I use a variety of techniques such as single-nucleus RNA-seq from multinucleated myotubes, RRBS, and bulk RNA-seq. We aim to uncover how the misexpression of a single transcription factor results in pathogenesis.
            \nI work and collaborate on many other projects including studying the transcriptomes of mammals and nematodes. I love having the opportunity to bring new insights into our understanding of other organisms and ourselves!
