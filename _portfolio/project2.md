TALON (**T**echnology-**A**gnostic **Lon**g-read) annotation software is designed to associate transcript identities to reads from long-read RNA-seq datasets. It works equally well for both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore data. It has currently be implemented by [ENCODE](http://encodeproject.org/) as a part of their uniform data-processing pipeline.
